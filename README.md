## V3 cases

SlimeVR Cases that can be used with my custom PCB.

### Component support:

* LSM6DSR IMU module or similar form factor (only with the same pin layout!)
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller, the cases are designed to hold this specific battery the best)
* Tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires to connect the switch
* Pinheaders if your D1 and other components didn't come with any
* The [custom pcbs](https://github.com/VaeluxV/Custom-SlimeVR-D1-BMI-PCB/releases/tag/v1.3.2)
* Battery connectors (JST or similar) if you wish to be able to disconnect the battery easily

Made with Blender 4.3
