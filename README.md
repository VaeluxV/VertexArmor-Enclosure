# VertexArmor-Enclosure
VertexArmor are my newest SlimeVR Cases with better charging port location, easier internal layout (toolless assembly) and a dock too! (Might require grabbing USB-C connectors from old/unused cables and some glue to secure them in place)

# V2 cases
Please note V2 **only** supports my custom PCB!
### Component support (V2):
* BMI160 (BMI270 should work, currently untested)
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires
* pinheaders if your D1 didn't come with any (to connect it to the pcb more easily)
* the [custom pcbs](https://github.com/VaeluxV/Custom-SlimeVR-D1-BMI-PCB/releases/tag/v1.3.2)

# V1 cases (LEGACY - no longer actively maintaned)
These cases are still in the files and should still be usable, however I do not actively update or support these anymore.

### Component support (V1):
* BMI160 (BMI270 might work, untested)
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires (Thinner, 26 AWG, wires preferred for easier soldering/mounting)

**For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation** (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

Made with Blender 3.6.1 / 4.0 / 4.1 (latest updates)
