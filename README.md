# Older versions

These are no longer supported but can still be found in the "/Older/" folder.

## V2 cases

Please note V2 **only** supports my custom PCB!

### Component support (V2):

* BMI160 (BMI270 and similar formats should work, currently untested)
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires
* pinheaders if your D1 and other components didn't come with any (to connect it to the pcb more easily, can be done without)
* the [custom pcbs](https://github.com/VaeluxV/Custom-SlimeVR-D1-BMI-PCB/releases/tag/v1.3.2)
Made with Blender 4.1

## V1 cases (LEGACY - no longer actively maintained)

These cases are still in the files and should still be usable, however I do not actively update or support these anymore.

### Component support (V1):

* BMI160 (BMI270 and similar might work, untested)
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
